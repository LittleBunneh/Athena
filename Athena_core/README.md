# Next-Generation Autonomous AI Project

This project scaffolds a modular, extensible, and secure AI system with the following features:

- Real machine learning integration (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Secure networking for distributed agents
- Plugin/module system for dynamic skill expansion
- Hardware/IoT integration APIs
- Persistent, queryable memory (database/vector store)
- Web/API access (with authentication and safety)
- Sandboxed self-modification
- Logging, monitoring, and ethical oversight modules
- User interface (CLI, web, or app)
- Documentation and safety controls

## Getting Started

1. Review the project structure and requirements in this README and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
2. Install dependencies as described in the setup instructions.
3. Follow the documentation for each subsystem to extend or deploy the AI.

> **Note:** This scaffold provides placeholders and best practices for each subsystem. Replace stubs with real implementations as you develop the project.
