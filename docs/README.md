# Next-Generation Autonomous AI Project

This project scaffolds a modular, extensible, and secure AI system with the following features:

- Real machine learning integration (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Secure networking for distributed agents
- Plugin/module system for dynamic skill expansion
- Hardware/IoT integration APIs
- Persistent, queryable memory (database/vector store)
- Web/API access (with authentication and safety)
- Sandboxed self-modification
- Logging, monitoring, and ethical oversight modules
- User interface (CLI, web, or app)
- Documentation and safety controls
